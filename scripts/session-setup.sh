# Claude Code SessionStart hook: a fast, NON-BLOCKING dev-environment check.
#
# It must never run the install itself. Provisioning takes minutes (a full rustup
# toolchain download plus tool installs), and doing that synchronously inside a
# SessionStart hook freezes the session until it finishes — the session waits on
# the hook. So this only runs the lightweight check and, when the environment is
# not ready, prints guidance for the agent to run `just setup` as a visible,
# interruptible first step. Stdout is injected as session context, so a ready
# environment stays silent.
#
# Set SCREENCOMP_AUTO_SETUP=1 to opt into hands-off provisioning: setup is then
# launched detached in the background (still non-blocking) instead of advised.
